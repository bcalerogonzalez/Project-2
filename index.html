      <p>This is a website that I created to complete Project 1 ITM 361 Fundamentals for Web development in which I am learning HTML5.</p>
      <p>HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages.</p> 
      <p>It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, which provides the structure; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which take care of</p>
      <p>presentation; and JavaScript, which makes things happen. HTML is the primary area of learning in this course module; therefore,</p>
      <p>this website will be limited to HTML formatting without CSS or JavaScript until my learning progress.</p>
      <p>In this website you will be viewing only html, this is the progress of what I have learned so far.</p>
      <p>This has helped me understand coding a bit more and it is also a great help to reach my goals as knowlegdable as possible.</p>
      <p>Below there is a link for video of what I want to do in my military career.</p>
