<div class="About me">
  <p>Hi, my name is Bryan Calero Gonzalez and I am a second-year undergraduate student at IIT.</p>
  <p>I am currently in the ITM program with expectations to graduate Spring 2021.</p>
  <p>So far I'm learning basics in web development, programming in Java, linux commands, as well as how to effectively</p>
  <p>manage projects, to just name a few things.I am currently working as a Information Technology Specialist for the military.</p>
  <p>I've been working in the armed forces since August 2012.</p>
  <p>I can honestly say that I take pride in serving in the military and I want to make a career out of it.</p>
  <p>I came to IIT to better myself and help grow my career and become a Cybersecurity Officer. It's also</P>
  <p>one of my personal goals to complete an undergraduate and graduate degree. I will be the first of my family to graduate college obtaining a Master's</P>
  <p>degree in Cybersecurity and forensics. I made a promise to someone that is very important to me that is why I can't accept failure or let this opportunity pass me by.</p>
